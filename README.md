## 🎯 Features
- **Grave System for Players**
When players die, their items and XP are safely stored in a Grave so they don't despawn.

- **Grave-Info Command**
Players can easily check the location of their graves, helping them recover items without wandering aimlessly.

- **Admin Grave Management**
Admins can list, inspect, teleport to, or remove graves. This makes it easy to help players or keep the world clean from abandoned graves.

- **Configurable Grave Behavior**
Decide whether Graves can be looted by other players, how much XP gets stored in them, and more.
